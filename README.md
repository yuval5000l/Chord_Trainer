Hi there! 
I uploaded a project I did in 2021, before I was in university and stuff
It's a chord trainer for a midi devices (like keys and stuff)

- Press f for fullscreen
- Press c to start the game
- Press esc to exit the game

The code is a bit messy, maybe I will make it better some day, maybe not \_(^__^)_/
